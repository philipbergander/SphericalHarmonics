# Spherical Harmonics

Calculates and animates spherical harmonics.

animateSphericalHarmonics.jl iterates through the degrees and orders without any smooth interpolated plot.
animateSphericalHarmonicsContinuous.jl does a linear interpolation of x,y and z values of the plot to create a smooth transform of the harmonics.
